# Layout Switcher

The switcher is a layout utility that will automatically make a row of items collapse to a single column when the content width is less than a specified size.

```
For wide screens, you get this.
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|           |           |           |           |
|           |           |           |           |
|           |           |           |           |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

For smaller screens, you get this.
There is no middle ground, either
a single row or a single column.

```

## Usage

```
<LayoutSwitcher>
  <div className="fpo"></div>
  <div className="fpo"></div>
  <div className="fpo"></div>
</LayoutSwitcher>
```

If you have a single child (ie, `<ul>`), the component will assume you want the grandchildren to be spaced and will set it up that way.

```
// This does the same as above, but uses a `ul` for the child wrapper instead.
<LayoutSwitcher>
  <ul>
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
  </ul>
</LayoutSwitcher>
```

Children will grow to take up 100% of available space. If design requires that they maintain a fixed max-width, pass the `noGrow` prop.

## Props

| Name     | Required | Type                                 | DefaultValue |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| children | yes      | React.ReactNode \| React.ReactNode[] |              |
| noGrow   |          | boolean                              | false        |
