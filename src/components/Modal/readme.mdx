# modal

A modal takes over the interface and blocks normal content until dismissed. When dismissed, focus should return to the opening interaction.

## Usage

Because we want to control the modal from outside of itself, we need to pass in our open/close function. This can be done with `useState()`.

```
const [openModal, setOpenModal] = useState(false);
```

Now, we set up the external button and the modal. These can exist next to each other since React-Modal will move the modal to a React portal. If we want to use `aria` attributes, we also need unique ids. These can be set manually or with a package called [shortid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid.)

```
<>
  <button onClick={() => setOpenModal(true)}>Open</button>
  <Modal
    isOpen={openModal}
    onRequestClose={() => setOpenModal(false)}
    aria={{
      labelledby: `UNIQUE-MODAL-TITLE`
    }}
  >
    <h2 id={`UNIQUE-MODAL-TITLE`}>
      First element in modal should be waypoint marker like a heading for AT
      users. It can be visibly hidden if desired.
    </h2>
    <button onClick={() => setOpenModal(false)}>Close</button>
  </Modal>
</>
```

This modal also has a wide class available. Pass `isWide` to use it.
