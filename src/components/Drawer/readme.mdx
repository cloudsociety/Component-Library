# Drawer

A drawer is a type of modal. The core difference between this and a standard modal is how it animates in.

## Usage

Because we want to control the drawer from outside of itself, we need to pass in our open/close function. This can be done with `useState()`.

```
const [openDrawer, setOpenDrawer] = useState(false);
```

Now, we set up the external button and the drawer. These can exist next to each other since React-Modal will move the drawer to a React portal. If we want to use `aria` attributes, we also need unique ids. These can be set manually or with a package called [shortid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid.)

```
<>
  <button onClick={() => setOpenDrawer(true)}>Open</button>
  <Drawer
    isOpen={openDrawer}
    onRequestClose={() => setOpenDrawer(false)}
    aria={{
      labelledby: `UNIQUE-MODAL-TITLE`
    }}
  >
    <h2 id={`UNIQUE-MODAL-TITLE`}>
      First element in modal should be waypoint marker like a heading for AT
      users. It can be visibly hidden if desired.
    </h2>
    <button onClick={() => setOpenDrawer(false)}>Close</button>
  </Drawer>
</>
```
